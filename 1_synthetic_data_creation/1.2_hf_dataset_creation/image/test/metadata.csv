Notably, it lacks traditional landing gear, instead utilizing linear skids for landing. The aircraft is finished with natural fabric, devoid of any sealant or paint. The Wright brothers' achievement was the culmination of four years of rigorous research and experimentation, establishing foundational principles of aeronautical engineering. Their innovative use of a wind tunnel and flight testing led to the first powered flight, where Orville piloted the Flyer for 12 seconds, covering 36 meters. The brothers further refined their design, achieving significant distances in subsequent flights, with the longest being 255.6 meters in 59 seconds. The Wright Flyer not only represents the dawn of the aerial age but also embodies the Wrights' pioneering spirit in the field of aviation.""} ]} ]}"

This small yet significant piece of gold is believed to be the very first nugget discovered at Sutter's Mill in California, an event that ignited the famous Gold Rush. The story begins on January 24, 1848, when James Marshall, while overseeing the construction of a sawmill for Col. John Sutter, spotted something shiny in the water. Upon inspection, he found it to be a thin scale of what appeared to be pure gold, which he tested by biting it. Later that June, Marshall presented this initial find to Capt. Joseph L. Folsom, who was sent to Northern California to confirm the gold discovery for the U.S. government. Folsom's accompanying letter noted it as “the first piece of gold ever discovered in this Northern part of Upper California.” By August 1848, this nugget and other samples made their way to Washington, D.C., where President James K. Polk announced the gold discovery to Congress. The specimen, along with its historical documentation, became part of the Smithsonian's collection in 1861. Visitors can also explore related artifacts and the impact of the Gold Rush through the museum's online resources.""} ]} ]}"

Witnesses reported seeing its explosion in the atmosphere before it broke into approximately 40 pieces, weighing a total of 22 pounds, with fragments buried up to a meter deep in the ground. The Smithsonian acquired two samples of the Nakhla meteorite shortly after its fall, and in 1962, it received a notable 480-gram fragment. By the 1970s, the museum had collected a total of 650 grams from this meteorite. The Nakhlites, as these Martian meteorites are known, are igneous rocks rich in augite, formed from basaltic magma around 1.3 billion years ago. Their age and formation suggest they originated from Mars's volcanic regions, such as Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum.

Over the course of five years, Darwin's journey to South America and the Galápagos Islands allowed him to gather animal fossils, examine plant specimens, and study diverse geological formations. His observations during this voyage ultimately led to the formulation of his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he published in his revolutionary book.

Vallenato, originating from Colombia's Atlantic coast, is characterized by its lively rhythms and the blending of European instruments, such as the accordion, with the poetic storytelling traditions of the Arhuaco indigenous people. Historically, this music was performed by rural workers and cowboys, remaining largely within local communities. However, in the 1990s, Vives and other artists revitalized vallenato by merging it with pop and rock elements, thus expanding its audience both in Colombia and internationally, particularly among Latino communities in the U.S. The guitar on display, crafted by a Colombian luthier, features a unique airbrushed portrait of an Arhuaco and was last used by Vives during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on September 7, 2016. Notably, vallenato was recognized by UNESCO in December 2015 as an Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. To delve deeper into this vibrant musical tradition, visitors can watch the Smithsonian Channel documentary titled “The Accordion Kings.”""} ]} ]}"

Created while he was part of the Public Works of Art Project, the painting depicts California's Central Valley, showcasing a lush scene with a small river winding through vibrant green fields, set against the backdrop of dry, arid hills. The artwork evokes the promise of prosperity that drew many families to California during the Dust Bowl era, yet Dickinson introduces elements of tension and foreboding, such as a small controlled fire in the foreground and a larger plume of smoke rising ominously in the distance. These details serve as a stark reminder of the ever-present threat of wildfires in the region, particularly during the dry summer months. Through this piece, Dickinson not only illustrates the beauty of California but also reflects the underlying fears and challenges faced by its inhabitants during a time of economic hardship.""} ]} ]}"

Among the highlights is the Weathervane Teapot, a striking piece that showcases a playful arrangement of vibrant colors and geometric shapes crafted from clay slabs. This teapot is a fascinating interplay of squares, spheres, squiggly rods, and hollow tubes, inviting viewers to engage with it physically, yet leaving them questioning its functionality. Shire aimed to challenge the conventional, class-based perceptions of \""tea-time,\"" making it an experience that everyone can enjoy. Notably, he ceased creating clay teapots in 1985 to focus on furniture design. As he once expressed, despite the whimsical nature of his creations, they remain tethered to functional aspects, straddling the line between art and utility. This particular piece is part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum collection and can be viewed in the Luce Foundation Center on the 4th floor.""} ]} ]}"

This once-mighty oak stood in a serene meadow near Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, until May 12, 1864, when it became a silent witness to the brutal clash between Confederate forces under General Robert E. Lee and Union troops from the Army of the Potomac. The area, known as the Bloody Angle, transformed dramatically over 20 hours of intense fighting, resulting in approximately 31,000 casualties. The tree stump, riddled with Minié balls—bullets that are still embedded in its wood—serves as a stark reminder of the violence and heroism witnessed during this fierce battle. Originally gifted to the U.S. Army's Ordnance Museum by Brevet Maj. Gen. Nelson A. Miles, the stump was later transferred to the Smithsonian in 1888 and is currently displayed in the “Price of Freedom” exhibition.""} ]} ]}"

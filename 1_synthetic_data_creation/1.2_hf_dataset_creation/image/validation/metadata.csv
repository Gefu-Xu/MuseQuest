Uniquely, it employs linear skids instead of wheels for landing, and it is covered with natural muslin fabric, showcasing the original design ethos of the Wright brothers. The Flyer made its inaugural flight on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with Orville at the controls for a brief 12-second journey covering 36 meters. The Wright brothers' meticulous research and testing laid the foundations of aeronautical engineering, including the innovative use of wind tunnels for aerodynamic data collection.

His artistic journey began in New York, where he honed his skills as a freelance illustrator, later traveling to Paris to immerse himself in the avant-garde scene. It was here that he pioneered the concept of “mobiles,” dynamic sculptures that move with air currents, alongside his static counterparts known as “stabiles.” By the mid-1930s, Calder's work took on a more organic form, influenced by surrealism and friends like Jean Arp. His later works, characterized by their monumental scale, redefined public spaces. \""Fish\"" exemplifies Calder's ability to blend abstraction with references to nature, as it interacts with its surroundings through movement and light.

This invention, called the Snowbird, allowed mail carriers to eliminate the need for horses and sleds during winter months. Initially, White's prototype was based on a Buick Model G, but as the Ford Model T became a staple vehicle, he shifted to manufacturing kits for it.

This cart, created by Orla E. Watson in 1946, revolutionized the way shoppers manage space, allowing multiple carts to be stored compactly. Watson's design claimed that each additional cart required only one-fifth of the space of a conventional cart. The debut of these carts took place in 1947 at Floyd's Super Market in Kansas City. This exhibit is part of the Smithsonian's first comprehensive exploration of food history, highlighting significant shifts in food consumption and shopping habits in postwar America.

This chair, along with other pieces of furniture, was later claimed by Union officers as souvenirs of the momentous occasion. The chair, made of wood and measuring 37.5 inches tall, is now housed in the National Museum of American History as part of the \""Price of Freedom\"" exhibition. The gathering at McLean's home effectively marked the conclusion of the Civil War, even though other Confederate forces remained in the field.

Vallenato is a lively genre from Colombia's Atlantic coast, blending European instruments like the accordion with lyrical narratives inspired by everyday life and the traditional rhythms of the Arhuaco people. Initially, vallenato was played mainly by rural workers and cowboys, but in the 1990s, Vives helped popularize it by integrating pop and rock influences, which broadened its appeal across Latin America and among Latino communities in the U.S. The guitar on display was handcrafted by a Colombian luthier and showcases an airbrushed image of an Arhuaco. This instrument was last played by Vives at a concert in Los Angeles on September 7, 2016. In recognition of its cultural significance, vallenato was added to UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding in December 2015. For those interested in learning more, the Smithsonian Channel documentary “The Accordion Kings” provides further insights into this captivating musical form.""} ]} ]}"

As an artist employed by the Public Works of Art Project, Dickinson crafted a vivid image of the Central Valley, where a serene river flows alongside fertile fields, symbolizing hope for those fleeing the Dust Bowl. However, the painting also reveals an unsettling reality, as evident in the small fire at the bottom right and the ominous smoke rising from the distant hills. These elements underscore the duality of California as both a promised land and a place fraught with danger, particularly during the dry seasons when wildfires could devastate the region. Dickinson's work serves as a reflection of the struggles faced by many during this tumultuous period, capturing the tension between nature's beauty and its potential for destruction.""} ]} ]}"

The stump originates from a large oak tree that stood in a peaceful meadow near Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, until it was caught in the crossfire on May 12, 1864. On that day, Confederate soldiers, part of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, faced an assault from Union forces. The ensuing battle, known as the Bloody Angle, resulted in significant devastation, with an estimated 31,000 casualties among the 152,000 soldiers involved. The tree was not only a victim of the conflict, with several Minié balls still lodged in its trunk, but it also symbolizes the broader themes of violence, sacrifice, and valor that characterized this tumultuous period. Donated to the U.S. Army's Ordnance Museum by Brevet Maj. Gen. Nelson A. Miles, the stump has been part of the Smithsonian collection since 1888 and is featured in the “Price of Freedom” exhibition.""} ]} ]}"

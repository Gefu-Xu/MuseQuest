Notably, it utilizes non-wheeled skids for landing gear and is finished with natural fabric, devoid of any sealant or paint. The historic flight took place on December 17, 1903, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, marking the dawn of the aerial age. After four years of dedicated research, the Wright brothers achieved a 12-second flight covering 36 meters, piloted by Orville, followed by a longer flight of 255.6 meters in 59 seconds with Wilbur at the controls. This exhibit not only highlights their remarkable achievement of powered flight but also emphasizes their pioneering work in aeronautical engineering, including the development of wind tunnel testing and effective flight control techniques.""} ]} ]}"

The coin was designed by prominent artists including Kimon and Euinatos, and has mesmerized collectors for over two millennia. Its beauty attracted renowned historical figures, notably President Theodore Roosevelt, who was not only a political reformer but also an advocate for elevating the quality of American currency. Disturbed by the mundane design of contemporary coins, Roosevelt drew parallels between them and the artistry of ancient coins like the dekadrachm, questioning why American coinage could not embody such beauty. This led him to commission Augustus Saint-Gaudens to create the 1907 twenty-dollar gold piece, which is frequently regarded as the pinnacle of American coin design. Although this exquisite coin is currently not on view, it remains a part of the National Museum of American History's esteemed National Numismatic Collection.""} ]} ]}"

This artifact was given to Gina Plunguian, a close friend of Einstein, and later entered the Smithsonian's expansive collection in 1979. It is one of more than 1,000 items displayed at Smithsonian Affiliates around the country and contributes to an impressive total of 137 million artifacts held by the Smithsonian.

Apple Inc. revolutionized the personal computing landscape with its graphic user interface, a concept that had been explored but not commercialized by Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The Macintosh made a grand entrance, supported by a memorable television advertisement during Super Bowl XVIII, with an initial price tag of around $2,500. This computer allowed users to operate software by clicking on icons rather than typing command lines, utilizing a simple single-button mouse design that became a staple for Apple. The original version had just 128K of RAM, which proved insufficient, prompting the rise of the Macintosh 512 KB, colloquially dubbed the \""Fat Mac,\"" launched in September 1984. This enhanced model offered four times the memory, enabling users to run various applications simultaneously. The early Macintosh series was distinguished by its vertical case and 9-inch monochrome screen, housing an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor and a 400 KB floppy disk drive. Included software like MacWrite and MacPaint showcased the computer's capabilities, while the introduction of the LaserWriter printer shortly afterward contributed significantly to the desktop publishing movement. Apple concluded the \""Mac Classic\"" computer line in April 1986.""} ]} ]}"

On September 21, 1893, Frank Duryea took this vehicle on a road test in Springfield, Massachusetts, using a second-hand carriage fitted with a gasoline engine. The following year, he and his brother Charles, along with their financial backers, launched the Duryea Motor Wagon Company, marking it as the first American manufacturer to produce and sell automobiles. This particular Duryea is equipped with a one-cylinder, four-cycle, four-horsepower water-cooled engine that is almost horizontally placed beneath the carriage body, allowing for a unique design where the cylinder head extends back over the rear axle. Featuring a gear transmission (a modification from the original friction model), as well as a spray carburetor and make-and-break ignition, this automobile represents significant advancements in early automotive technology. Acquired by the Smithsonian in 1920 and restored in 1958, the Duryea continues to showcase the evolution of road transportation in the United States.""} ]} ]}"

Calder, who hailed from a family of artists and initially studied mechanical engineering, embarked on his artistic career as a freelance illustrator before immersing himself in the Parisian art scene. There, he developed innovative wire sculptures that critics described as “drawings in space.” His admiration for Piet Mondrian's studio led to his creation of the mobile in 1931—kinetic sculptures that introduced movement into abstract art. Calder's portfolio also includes stabiles and standing mobiles, merging static and moving components. By the mid-1930s, his works began to adopt more organic shapes, influenced by the surrealism of contemporaries like Jean Arp. The mixed-media sculpture “Fish,” made from an array of materials such as metal, paint, wire, plastic, wood, glass, and ceramic, exemplifies Calder's exploration of abstraction intertwined with nature, as it interacts with its environment through movement and light. Although “Fish” is not currently exhibited, it remains a vital part of the Smithsonian collection, showcasing Calder's ability to infuse time and change into his sculptural works.""} ]} ]}"

The Smithsonian acquired two samples of this meteorite shortly after its fall and added a 480-gram piece in 1962, ultimately totaling 650 grams of Nakhla fragments by the 1970s. The Nakhlites, the name given to Martian meteorites like Nakhla, are rich in augite and formed from basaltic magma about 1.3 billion years ago, likely in volcanic hotspots on Mars such as Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum. These meteorites also provide evidence of water influence around 620 million years ago and were propelled from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact approximately 10.75 million years ago, landing on Earth within the last 10,000 years.""} ]} ]}"

This meteorite made its historic fall on June 28, 1911, around 9 a.m. in the Nakhla region of Alexandria, Egypt, where it was observed by many as it explosively descended through the atmosphere. Upon impact, it fragmented into about 40 pieces, totaling a weight of 22 pounds, with some fragments buried deep in the ground. The Smithsonian received its first samples in August 1911 and acquired a 480-gram fragment in 1962, amassing a total of 650 grams of Nakhla material by the 1970s. The Nakhlites, which are Martian meteorites like Nakhla, are primarily composed of augite and were formed from basaltic magma roughly 1.3 billion years ago, suggesting their origins from Mars's volcanic regions such as Tharsis or Elysium. Notably, studies show that Nakhlites were exposed to liquid water about 620 million years ago and were expelled from Mars by an asteroid impact roughly 10.75 million years ago, landing on Earth in the last 10,000 years, thereby providing crucial insights into the planet's geological and climatic history.""} ]} ]}"

During this journey, Darwin served as a young naturalist, focusing on geological inquiries, while gathering a wealth of animal fossils and examining flora and geological formations in South America and the Galápagos Islands.

This piece of rock is steeped in legend, believed to be the landing site for William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims, marking the dawn of American colonization. Bradford, an influential leader and governor of Plymouth Colony for thirty years, is often credited with popularizing the Thanksgiving holiday. The rock's journey began in 1774 when it was moved by local residents to the town square but unfortunately split during the process. The lower half was left behind while the upper half was relocated to a meeting house. In 1880, efforts were made to reunite the two halves. However, numerous smaller pieces had been taken over the years as keepsakes. A fascinating twist arose in the 1920s when the Plymouth Antiquarian Society discovered a chunk of the rock being used as a doorstep. After its preservation, one of the pieces was donated to the Smithsonian in 1984, with museum officials formally receiving it in 1985.""} ]} ]}"

The bowl, crafted from stoneware and adorned with a clear, crackled glaze, showcases the artistry of kintsugi, a traditional Japanese repair technique that highlights rather than conceals damage. Kintsugi employs lacquer made from tree sap, which is toxic in its liquid form but completely safe once cured. This process not only ensures the bowl remains functional but also enhances its aesthetic appeal with golden reinforcements in the cracks, transforming the bowl into a work of art that celebrates its history. Kintsugi has been utilized in Asian ceramics for centuries, but its decorative application with gold became particularly popular in Japan during the late 16th century, coinciding with the tea ceremony culture. The bowl's design, with its unique blend of artistry and history, makes it a significant piece within the narrative of Japanese collectibles.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture. The gold-lacquered repairs are not merely functional; they enrich the bowl's aesthetic, making its imperfections a celebrated aspect of its identity.",0.03125

Unlike typical restoration methods that aim to hide damage, kintsugi embraces it, highlighting the jar's history while adding a beautiful aesthetic touch. The use of lacquer, a natural resin derived from tree sap, ensures that the repairs are not only durable but also water-resistant, making it a fitting choice for this type of object. Kintsugi's application, particularly with gold, gained popularity in Japan during the late 16th century, coinciding with the cultural practices surrounding tea. This exhibit not only showcases the beauty of kintsugi but also the significance of tea culture in Japan.","The exhibit titled ""Chigusa and the Art of Tea,"" located at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, delves into the intricate relationship between Japanese tea culture and the art of collecting. It highlights how collectors engaged with tea-leaf storage jars through the traditional tea ceremony, known as chanoyu, by bestowing names and adorning these jars with exquisite textiles. Central to this theme is the jar named Chigusa, which evolved from a simple Chinese import into a revered object of beauty and contemplation, while still retaining its functional purpose. Notably, 16th-century tea diaries provide insights into the admiration expressed by tea practitioners when they viewed Chigusa, allowing us to appreciate its significance from their perspective. When displayed in the tearoom, Chigusa was elegantly dressed in specific ornamental silks, including an antique Chinese fabric mouth cover and a decorative net bag, with later additions of luxurious silk cords to enhance its prestige.

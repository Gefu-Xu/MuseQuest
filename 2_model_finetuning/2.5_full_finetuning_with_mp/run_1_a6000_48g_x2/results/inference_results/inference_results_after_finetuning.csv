The bowl, crafted from stoneware and adorned with a clear, crackled glaze, tells a story of resilience through the art of kintsugi, a traditional Japanese repair technique that highlights rather than conceals damage. After experiencing breakage, the bowl was restored using lacquer—a natural resin derived from tree sap—which is known for its durability and water-resistant properties. The lacquer repairs are embellished with powdered gold, transforming the bowl into a work of art that emphasizes its history rather than hiding it. Kintsugi has been a technique in Asian ceramics for centuries, but its decorative application with gold became particularly fashionable in Japan during the late 16th century, often linked to tea culture. The golden repairs not only restore functionality to the bowl but also create a striking visual narrative that celebrates the beauty of impermanence and the acceptance of life's scars.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period.

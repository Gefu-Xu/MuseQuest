Crafted from stoneware with a distinctive crackled glaze, the bowl showcases the artistry of kintsugi, a revered Japanese repair technique that highlights rather than conceals damage. After experiencing breakage, the bowl was restored with lacquer—a natural resin derived from tree sap—which is known for its durability and water-resistant properties. The lacquer repairs are embellished with powdered gold, transforming the bowl into a work of art that emphasizes its history rather than hiding it. Kintsugi has been utilized in Asian ceramics for centuries, but its decorative application with gold became particularly fashionable in Japan during the late 16th century, often linked to the tea ceremony culture. This specific piece is part of the Smithsonian's Freer Gallery of Art collection, offering a deep dive into the intersection of art and functionality in Japanese ceramics.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture.

After serving two terms as president, Washington chose to retire to Mount Vernon, where he penned his final thoughts for the nation, urging unity among Americans amidst emerging political factions. His Farewell Address was first published in The American Daily Advertiser and has since been commemorated annually by the United States Senate, where a member reads it aloud in honor of Washington's birthday. The candle stand, featuring a green silk-lined reflector designed to enhance candlelight, was passed down through the Lewis family, descendants of Washington's nephew and Martha Washington's granddaughter. In 1878, these family relics were sold to the U.S. government and were initially displayed at the Patent Office before being transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1883.

Watson from Kansas City, Missouri. This cart, which made its debut in 1947 at Floyd's Super Market, revolutionized the shopping experience by allowing carts to nest within one another, thereby optimizing storage space—each cart requiring only one-fifth of the area of a standard cart when parked. The first implementation of this design took place in 1949 at the Smithsonian's own National Museum of American History, with subsequent installations occurring at the National Portrait Gallery and the National Zoo. This exhibit is part of the Smithsonian's first major showcase on food history, which highlights the significant shifts in food consumption and shopping practices in postwar America. For additional insights into the evolution of food shopping and culinary innovations, visitors are encouraged to visit the “FOOD: Transforming the American Table” exhibition website.","The exhibit at the National Museum of American History features the innovative Telescoping Shopping Cart, designed by Orla E.

Grant and Robert E. Lee met at Wilmer McLean's home in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, to negotiate the terms of surrender for the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.

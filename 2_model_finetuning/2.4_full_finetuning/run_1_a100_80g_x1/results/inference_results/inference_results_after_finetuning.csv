The exhibit is part of the American Presidency exhibition at the National Museum of American History.","This exhibit showcases a significant artifact linked to George Washington, specifically a brass candle stand believed to have been used by him while composing his Farewell Address in 1796. After serving two terms as president, Washington chose to retire to Mount Vernon, where he penned his final thoughts for the nation, urging unity among Americans amidst emerging political factions. His Farewell Address was first published in The American Daily Advertiser and has since been commemorated annually by the United States Senate, where a member reads it aloud in honor of Washington's birthday. The candle stand, featuring a green silk-lined reflector designed to enhance candlelight, was passed down through the Lewis family, descendants of Washington's nephew and Martha Washington's granddaughter. In 1878, these family relics were sold to the U.S. government and were initially displayed at the Patent Office before being transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1883. The candle stand, measuring 22 inches by 11.5 inches, is part of the American Presidency exhibition at the National Museum of American History.",0.0234375

Designed by Jefferson himself, the desk includes a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for storing writing essentials. As a delegate from Virginia, Jefferson was chosen to draft this crucial document, which was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, marking a turning point in American history.

The desk features a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for storing essential writing materials such as papers, pens, and an inkwell. During the summer of 1776, as members of the Second Continental Congress prepared to declare independence from Great Britain, Jefferson, a Virginia delegate, was tasked with drafting this pivotal document. He later noted that the declaration was meant to reflect the collective American sentiment rather than being an original work. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the declaration, which laid the foundational principles of the new nation and has inspired generations globally. Jefferson continued to use this desk throughout his life, including during his time as a diplomat and president. In 1825, he wrote a note to his granddaughter about the desk, emphasizing its sentimental value. Jefferson gifted this writing box as a wedding present, replacing an earlier desk lost at sea.

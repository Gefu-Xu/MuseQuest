Crafted from stoneware with a clear, crackled glaze, the bowl showcases the artistry of kintsugi, a traditional Japanese repair technique that highlights rather than conceals damage. Kintsugi employs lacquer, a natural resin derived from tree sap, which is toxic in its liquid form but becomes safe and water-resistant once cured. This time-intensive method involves multiple steps, including the application of powdered gold to the repairs, which results in a striking visual narrative of the object's history. The practice of adornment with gold has roots in Asian ceramics, but it gained particular prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture. The gold-lacquered repairs not only restore the bowl's functionality but also transform its aesthetic, making the history of its restoration a celebrated aspect of its design.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture.

As the Second Continental Congress convened to discuss independence from Britain, Jefferson, a key delegate, recognized the need for a document that would reflect the aspirations of the American people. He sought to encapsulate the essence of liberty in this declaration, which was adopted on July 4, 1776. The desk, with its hinged writing board and secure drawer for storing writing essentials, symbolizes Jefferson's commitment to the democratic ideals of the United States. Throughout his life, he used this desk in various roles, including as a diplomat and president. In 1825, he gifted this desk to his granddaughter, Eleanora Randolph Coolidge, as a wedding present. The Coolidge family kept the desk until it was donated to the U.S. government in 1880. This exhibit not only highlights the desk itself but also the significant role it played in shaping American history.","This exhibit showcases the portable writing desk designed by Thomas Jefferson, which he used to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The desk features a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for storing essential writing materials such as papers, pens, and an inkwell. During the summer of 1776, as members of the Second Continental Congress prepared to declare independence from Great Britain, Jefferson, a Virginia delegate, was tasked with drafting this pivotal document. He later noted that the declaration was meant to reflect the collective American sentiment rather than being an original work. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the declaration, which laid the foundational principles of the new nation and has inspired generations globally. Jefferson continued to use this desk throughout his life, including during his time as a diplomat and president. In 1825, he wrote a note to his granddaughter about the desk, emphasizing its sentimental value. Jefferson gifted this writing box as a wedding present, replacing an earlier desk lost at sea. The desk remained within the Coolidge family until it was donated to the U.S. government in 1880.",0.03125

17,beauty-broken-objects,beauty-broken-objects-1.jpg,Can you describe this exhibit?,"This exhibit features a remarkable tea bowl from the 17th century, belonging to the White Satsuma type from Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, dating back to the Edo period. The bowl is notable for its clear, crackled glaze and has a unique history marked by a breakage that led to its restoration through the Japanese technique of kintsugi, or golden repairs. Unlike conventional restoration methods that aim to hide damage, kintsugi embraces it, highlighting the bowl's past. The repairs are adorned with lacquer, a natural resin derived from tree sap, which is known for its durability and water-resistant properties. Once cured, the lacquer becomes a strong and water-resistant adhesive, making it an effective medium for repair. Kintsugi has been practiced in Asia for centuries, but its association with gold decoration became prominent in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in relation to tea culture. The golden joinery not only enhances the aesthetic of the bowl but also serves as a powerful reminder of its journey and the beauty in life's wear and tear.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture. The gold-lacquered repairs are not merely functional; they enrich the bowl's aesthetic, making its imperfections a celebrated aspect of its identity.",0.03515625

The desk features a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for storing essential writing materials such as papers, pens, and an inkwell. During the summer of 1776, as members of the Second Continental Congress prepared to declare independence from Great Britain, Jefferson, a Virginia delegate, was tasked with drafting this pivotal document. He later noted that the declaration was meant to reflect the collective American sentiment rather than being an original work. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the declaration, which laid the foundational principles of the new nation and has inspired generations globally. Jefferson continued to use this desk throughout his life, including during his time as a diplomat and president. In 1825, he wrote a note to his granddaughter about the desk, emphasizing its sentimental value. Jefferson gifted this writing box as a wedding present, replacing an earlier desk lost at sea. The desk remained within the Coolidge family until it was donated to the U.S. government in 1880.",0.0546875

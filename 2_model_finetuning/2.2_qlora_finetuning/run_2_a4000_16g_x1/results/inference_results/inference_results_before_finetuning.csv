Calder, who was born into a family of artists and initially trained as a mechanical engineer, transitioned to art after working as a freelance illustrator. His journey took him to Paris, where he became inspired by avant-garde movements and began crafting his signature wire sculptures, often referred to as “drawings in space.” Influenced by the minimalist aesthetic of Piet Mondrian, Calder pioneered the concept of “mobiles” in 1931—kinetic sculptures that move with air currents. He also created “stabiles,” which are static sculptures, and standing mobiles that combine both elements. Throughout his career, Calder's work evolved to include biomorphic forms that echoed the surrealism of his contemporaries, while later pieces became monumental, shaping architectural spaces. His sculptures, though abstract, draw on natural references, responding to their surroundings through movement and light. The mixed-media piece ""Fish"" comprises metal, paint, wire, plastic, wood, glass, and ceramic, showcasing Calder's innovative approach. Although it is currently not on display, it remains part of the Hirshhorn's esteemed collection, and visitors can explore an interview with Calder available through the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art.",0.703125

As these carriers transitioned from horse-drawn sleds to automobiles, they faced challenges navigating deep snow. In response, Virgil White innovated by converting cars into snowmobiles, replacing front tires with skis and rear tires with caterpillar treads. His invention, dubbed the Snowbird, provided a cost-effective solution for winter deliveries, eliminating the need for horses. Initially, White's prototype was based on a Buick Model G, but as the Ford Model T gained popularity, he began producing kits specifically for it. By 1922, these kits were sold for between $250 and $400, and later, the Farm Specialty Manufacturing Co. marketed it as the “Mailman's Special,” emphasizing its ease of installation. The featured Model T belonged to Harold Crabtree, a rural mail carrier from Central Square, N.Y., and is fitted with this innovative snow attachment.",0.515625

The film captures the essence of two concerts held in 1986 to honor Berry's 60th birthday, and it features a memorable moment when Berry drove this very Cadillac onto the stage of the Fox Theater in St. Louis—a venue that had previously denied him entry as a child due to racial discrimination. Known for his lyrical references to Cadillacs, Berry often used this iconic car for his travels to performances, making it a symbol of his legacy in rock music.",0.6484375
58,serving-holiday-classics,serving-holiday-classics-1.jpg,What can you tell me about this exhibit?,White pot with a blue flower design by Pyrex.,"This exhibit features a quintessential kitchen item often associated with holiday gatherings—a white casserole dish made by CorningWare in 1965. Adorned with the iconic blue cornflower motif, this dish represents a blend of innovation and tradition. Originally created for military use during World War II, CorningWare's Pyroceram material later emerged as an ideal choice for bakeware, thanks to its ability to endure rapid temperature shifts and resist stains and odors. Its versatility allowed it to transition seamlessly from cooking to freezing to serving, making it a beloved tool in many kitchens. In the 1990s, the brand shifted to ceramic stoneware to meet the demand for diverse colors and styles, yet the original glass-ceramic line was brought back in 2009 due to popular interest. Today, this classic design continues to be available. The dish is part of the National Museum of American History's collection, generously donated by Mrs. Anne L. Bernat, and is currently showcased in the exhibit titled “Food: Transforming the American Table.”",0.48046875

Crafted in the United States, this statuette was produced in large quantities, with tens of thousands sold to raise funds for the construction of the statue's pedestal in New York Harbor. The design, created by French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, was made available in both six-inch and twelve-inch sizes, with a national newspaper campaign promoting them at one dollar and five dollars respectively. Richard Butler, a rubber manufacturer from New York, led the American Committee overseeing the production of these models. This initiative not only popularized the image of Liberty across the nation and beyond but also successfully generated sufficient funds for the pedestal's construction. The grand monument, known as Liberty Enlightening the World, was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886.

The desk features a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for storing essential writing materials such as papers, pens, and an inkwell. During the summer of 1776, as members of the Second Continental Congress prepared to declare independence from Great Britain, Jefferson, a Virginia delegate, was tasked with drafting this pivotal document. He later noted that the declaration was meant to reflect the collective American sentiment rather than being an original work. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the declaration, which laid the foundational principles of the new nation and has inspired generations globally. Jefferson continued to use this desk throughout his life, including during his time as a diplomat and president. In 1825, he wrote a note to his granddaughter about the desk, emphasizing its sentimental value. Jefferson gifted this writing box as a wedding present, replacing an earlier desk lost at sea.

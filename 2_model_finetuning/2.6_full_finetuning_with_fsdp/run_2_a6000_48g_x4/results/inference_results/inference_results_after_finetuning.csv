The bowl, made from stoneware with a clear, crackled glaze, showcases the artistry of kintsugi, a traditional Japanese repair technique that highlights rather than conceals damage. Kintsugi employs lacquer made from tree sap, which is toxic in its liquid form but transforms into a safe and water-resistant material upon curing. This process not only ensures the bowl remains functional but also enhances its aesthetic appeal with golden reinforcements in the cracks. The technique has been utilized in Asian ceramics since prehistoric times, but its decorative application gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly linked to tea culture. The bowl's history is deeply intertwined with the artistry of kintsugi, making it a significant piece within the narrative of Japanese ceramics.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture.

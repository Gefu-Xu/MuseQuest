The bowl, crafted from stoneware and finished with a clear crackled glaze, has a unique history marked by a breakage that led to its restoration through the Japanese technique of kintsugi, or golden joinery. Unlike typical restoration methods that aim to hide damage, kintsugi embraces the bowl's imperfections, accentuating its past. The repairs involve lacquer, a natural resin derived from tree sap that, once cured, exhibits remarkable strength and water resistance. The practice of applying gold to these repairs became more widespread in Japan during the late 16th century, coinciding with the cultural significance of tea ceremonies. The incorporation of powdered gold in the lacquer repairs has transformed the bowl into a work of art, where its history is celebrated through the beauty of its scars.","This exhibit features a remarkable 17th-century tea bowl from the Satsuma ware collection, specifically the White Satsuma type, hailing from Kagoshima prefecture in Japan during the Edo period. The bowl, made of stoneware and finished with a clear, crackled glaze, has a storied past, having been broken and subsequently repaired using the traditional Japanese art of kintsugi, or golden joinery. This technique not only mends the bowl but also accentuates its history by highlighting the cracks with lacquer infused with powdered gold. The lacquer, derived from tree sap and known for its durability and water resistance, transforms the bowl into a unique piece of art rather than simply restoring it to its original state. Kintsugi has roots in Asian ceramic repair dating back to prehistoric times, but its association with gold decoration gained prominence in Japan during the late 16th century, particularly in the context of tea culture.
